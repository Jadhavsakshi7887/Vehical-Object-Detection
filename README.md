#  Vehicle Object Detection â€“ YOLOv8 (Bangalore Traffic)

This project demonstrates **real-time vehicle object detection** using the **YOLOv8 model**, trained on **2,000+ images** captured from **Bangalore traffic conditions**.  
The system is designed to identify and track vehicles in challenging urban traffic environments.

---

## Features
- Trained on a **custom dataset** of Bangalore traffic.  
- Detects cars, bikes, buses, trucks, auto-rickshaws, and more.  
- Built with [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).  
- Works with **images, videos, and live webcam feeds**.
